Tools used to create this project:

python (2.7 since wxPython not 3-compatible)

I'm using Aptana Studio 3 as an IDE. You should be able to use others just
fine.

I've been expirmenting with the eric4 IDE, and added configuration files for
it to the source. However, I find that while it's fast (much better than
Aptana), it is a) not easy to use, b) not documented, and c) seems to lack
some of the features I've come to rely on in Aptana, like pop-ups for method
signatures, go to definition of function, etc. Of course some of the things
in c) might be configurable, but it's hard to tell due to a) and b).
