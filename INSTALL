1. Make sure you have python 3.2 installed. Earlier versions of 3 may work, but
are not tested. With the use of pyGTK, and the fact that pyserial supports
python 3, version 2 is not required, and I'm not trying
to maintain backward compatibility. I've got enough problems without that, sorry.

2. (optional) Create a virtual environment for the code to live in. If you
don't use virtualenv, you should definitely check it out
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv). I use virtualenvwrapper to make life
even easier (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper).

3. Use pip to install required python extensions. From the top-level directory
you can say:

    pip -r modules.pip 

4. If you are using a recent linux distribution, you probably have pyGTK
installed already. If not, you'll need to get it. The version for gtk 3 is
now called pyGObject, at http://live.gnome.org/PyGObject/. It's possible an
earlier version will work, except that the import statement has changed. I
haven't tried.

5. Modern Linux kernels should recognize the FTDI serial adapter for your XBee,
and set it up automatically. On Ubuntu (and Fedora), I'm seeing the first radio
as /dev/ttyUSB0.

6. For Windows, you can go to your manufacturer's web site. I went to 
http://digi.com and downloaded x-ctu and Windows 7 USB serial port drivers.

7. To fix bogus error message from list_ports() (NameError: 'base'), I had to
apply patch to pyserial:

By the time you read this, it's probably been promoted to production.
