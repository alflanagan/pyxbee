1. Make sure you have python 2.7 installed. Earlier versions may work but I'm
not trying to avoid 2.7-only features, so you're on your own. Python 3 will,
alas, only be feasible when wxPython supports it. If you want to recode the
graphics in tkinter, be my guest. Better you than me. ;)

2. (optional) Create a virtual environment for the code to live in. If you
don't use virtualenv, you should definitely check it out
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv). I use virtualenvwrapper to make life
even easier (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper).

3. Use pip to install required python extensions. From the top-level directory
you can say:

    pip -r modules.pip 

4. Install wxPython (http://wxpython.org). If you're on Windows, you may be
able to use "pip install wxpython"; unfortunately that doesn't seem to work for
Unix. You may have an adequate version pre-installed. I'm developing with
version 2.9. Version 2.8 proved to have some significant problems with wx.TextCtl.

5. Modern Linux kernels should recognize the FTDI serial adapter for your XBee,
and set it up automatically. On Ubuntu, I'm seeing the first radio as /dev/ttyUSB0.
Hopefully at some point I can add some detection capability so you don't have to
tell the software where it is.

6. For Windows, you can go to your manufacturer's web site. I went to 
http://digi.com and downloaded x-ctu and Windows 7 USB serial port drivers.
