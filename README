This is a project to develop a higher-level python interface to XBee miniature
radios. There's a nice package called XBee 2 to handle the low-level stuff -
send a frame, receive a frame, etc. I want to be able to code in terms of a
more abstract interface and not have to know which AT command does what, etc.

I pronounce it like "pie ex bee", but if you prefer to make it sound like
"pyxie" no one's stopping you. :)
