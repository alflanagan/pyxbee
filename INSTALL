1. Make sure you have python 2.7 installed. Earlier versions may work but I'm not trying to avoid 2.7-only features, so you're on your own.
2. (optional) Create a virtual environment for the code to live in. If you don't use virtualenv, you should definitely check it out (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv). I use virtualenvwrapper to make life even easier (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper).
3. Use pip to install required python extensions. From the top-level directory you can say
    pip -r modules.pip 
4. Install wxGlade if you want to change the UI files. If you edit the wxGlade-generated files, be careful to only modify parts of the file wxGlade doesn't write to. wxGlade design files end in .wxg; generated files will have the same name but a .py extension.
5. If you don't want to install wxGlade, you will need wxPython (http://wxpython.org). If you're on windows, you may be able to use "pip install wxpython"; unfortunately that doesn't seem to work for Unix.
