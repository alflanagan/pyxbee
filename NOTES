This should be a sort of running blog of comments on the overall project.

3/31/12:
Added another tab to notebook. However, I think I've over-complicated this; we
might be better served by replacing the notebook entirely with some sort of rich
text control. When a new item is selected we'd just re-write the control
contents.

Discovered the wonder of spacers and began adding some to layout, to improve
appearance. Layout continues to be a challenge, it looks like I might be better
off replacing GridSizers with nested BoxSizers.

As of now I'm giving up on wxGlade. The USBProbeMain.py file will now be updated
by hand, and USBProbe.wxg will be removed. wxGlade has a nice interface but is
WAY too buggy to be useful. Time saved with tool < time lost dealing with weird
UI issues and (occasionally) hand-editing corrupted XML.

So far I have been unable to find a decent free graphical UI designer for
wxPython. WTF? wxGlade seems moribund, pythoncard hasn't been updated in years.
Did everyone give up on layout editors and do it by hand?
