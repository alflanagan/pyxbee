1. Make sure you have python 2.7 installed. Earlier versions may work but I'm
not trying to avoid 2.7-only features, so you're on your own.

2. (optional) Create a virtual environment for the code to live in. If you
don't use virtualenv, you should definitely check it out
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv). I use virtualenvwrapper to make life
even easier (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper).

3. Use pip to install required python extensions. From the top-level directory
you can say:

    pip -r modules.pip 

4. Install wxPython (http://wxpython.org). If you're on Windows, you may be
able to use "pip install wxpython"; unfortunately that doesn't seem to work for
Unix. You may have an adequate version pre-installed. I'm developing with
version 2.8, don't know if the code is compatible with earlier versions.

5. To set up the XBee radio on a serial port in Linux: see 
http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?12,4546. I added the line
usbserial vendor=0x4348 product=0x5523
to my /etc/modules file.

6. For Windows, you can go to your manufacturer's web site. I went to 
http://digi.com and downloaded x-ctu and Windows 7 USB serial port drivers.
